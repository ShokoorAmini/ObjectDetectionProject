Introduction:
Object detection in real world environments with varying lighting, camera angles, and occlusions is a difficult task. To solve this problem, we used Advanced object detection algorithm, by using COCO-SSD deep learning-based object detection algorithms, we were able to achieve much higher accuracy in object detection.
Literature: https://blog.tensorflow.org/2021/01/custom-object-detection-in-browser.html, in this website they used customed train data but we used pre trained model called COCO-SSD. The model has been trained on a diverse set of objects and can recognize them accurately. It has a low false-positive rate and rarely makes incorrect identifications.	
Data & Methods:
We used React.js for a standalone front-end application and we capture images from a webcam for object detection and in the last part we make detections using TensorFlow.JS. in addition, we used COCO-SSD object identification model which  uses deep learning to identify and categorize items in photos. It is built on a neural network design that effectively detects objects of various sizes and scales by combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with feature pyramid networks (FPNs).

Result:
   As you can see the result that it detects objects like Human, bottle, cell phone, etc.	

 
Discussion:
Critical Review: The course was interesting. It enticed us to learn and dig some information about Machine learning and Deep learning. However, the only drawback of our course was that it was held online, and we could not quite grasp the real knowledge and joy out of it.
